# AMFM_demo

Simulation and optimization of 2-qubit Molmer Sorensen gates with 1-D ion traps using amplitude and frequency modulations. The gates are nominally divided into FM and AMFM classes. Given a motional mode spectrum, the optimization minimizes ion motion given a specific gate time. The data for motional frequencies and mode structures are calculated from separate simulations.
